In later years, John Kell recalled his mother hiding him and his little brother Thomas in the bushes at night during the Revolutionary War for fear their house would be burned by the British or Tories.

After deciding to enter the ministry, John began his studies in SC, but then
went to Scotland where he graduated from Glasgow University. Upon his return
to SC, he did considerable missionary work in the wester territories until
going to Princeton, IN, where he founded the Reformed Presbyterian Church of
Princeton.

In his "Sketch of the Covenanters of Rocky Creek, S.C.," historian Daniel
Greene Stinson wrote, "John studied under old Mr. Orr, graduated at Glasgow,
Scotland, studied theology, was licensed and came home a preacher. He settled,
in 1810, at Princeton, Ind. In the spring of 1831, he visited his birthplace,
preached several times and dispensed the Lord's Supper at the Brick Church to
a large audiance. It was a lovely day and the exercises were conducted at the
Stand.  Rev. Kell preached the action service which was tedious, then he began
the Communion and became ill...This was the last Convanter Communion ever held
in S.C."

Further on, the sketch says, "Rev. John Kell weighed about 200 pounds, had a
wild, wondering look, wore a wig, and usually spoke with tobacco in his mouth.
He was a nondescript. He was more easily understood by the Scotch-Irish than
by others. At home he was kind, accomodating and witty. He once said, 'Greens
in this country are not so bitter as in Carolina,' and then pressed a guest to
try some. His wife was a paragon but they were childless. He has long since
gone to his reward."<BR>
