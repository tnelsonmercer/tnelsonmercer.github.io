Thomas and Margaet made thier home near the Beaver Dam waters of Rocky Creek,
where they lived for the next 22 years. Thomas apparently began planning to
move his family to Illinois as early as 1818. On Oct. 7 of that year, he made
application to the government land office of Shawneetwon from his home in
Chester Co, SC (or perhaps he made a trip to Illinoise to make the
application). In either case, his application reads "Thomas KELL of Chester
Discrict, S.C." He was issued Land Entry Certificate No. 526 for the east half
of Section 4, T1S, R2E (Rome Twp.), Jefferson Co, IL, containing 287.74 acres.
He paid $579.88, plus interest, based on a rate of $2 per acre. He paid
$144.97 when he made application and the balance after he came to Illinois in
1822.

In the late summer of 1822 (by which time both his father and mother were
dead), Thomas, his wife and 9 of his then 11 children started the journey to
Illinois. His two oldest sons remained in SC where they lived out their lives.
His eldest daughter had married and she and her family came with Thomas. They
traveled in ox-drawn covered wagons and it must have been a bone-harring
journey before reaching the flat prairie land of Illinois. According to the
family stories, Margaret (GASTON) KELL rode horseback part of the way,
carrying her youngest child in the saddle with her. The beliefs of the
Covenanters were such that it was considered sinful to travel on the Sabbath,
so it was necessary to wait over until Monday before resuming each week. It
took them about six weeks to reach their destination near Walnut Hill.

After reaching Illinois in the fall of 1822, Thomas built his house, probably
a log structure, in Jefferson Co. There was no church in the area, of course,
since it was practically a wilderness. An old history says that when Thomas
reached the Walnut Hill area "there was not one house on the prairie."  The
people of the Walnut Hill area, many of whom were Scotch-Irish Covenanters,
organized and held prayer meetings in various members' homes. This was the
start of teh Walnut Hill Reformed Presbyteriam Church, and Thomas was one of
the organizers and charter members. In time, this church became more
familiarly known as the Old Covenanter Church.  According to tradition,
Margaret chose the site of the first church building, a log structure, and the
cemetery, and her son-in-law donated the land. Margaret, who died in 1831, was
the first person buried in the cemetery.

In a pioneer settlement such as Walnut Hill there were no doctors. Thomas is
said to have had a knowledge of medicine and acted as the doctor for the
community.  In later years, one of his descendants, Berthold BOGGS, wrote of
him, "Thomas KELL was a grand and noble man, a leader in all worthy and good
enterprises of the community, a leader in church and school and everthing that
would elevate and profit society. He had a consierable knowledge of medicine
and was, in fact, the neighborhood doctor. He could set broken bone, heal
woulds and prescribe medicine with as much accuracy as some graduate in the
profession. He was an ardent friend and was always safe and reliable counsel."

In "The History of Marion & Clinton Counties, Illinois, it was said of him,
"Uncle Tommy KELL was teh first man to sell goods in Marion Couty. He at one
time, took to St. Louis 600 dozen rabbit skins, for which he paid $0.50 per
dozen, and sole them at the same price. He had, however, paid for them with
goods upon which he had realized a safe profit."

Thomas's twelfth and last child was born in 1825, three years after the move
to Illinois, and the only child not born in S.C.  After the death of his wife
in 1831, Thomas remarried in 1834. In June of 1836, he bought a tract of land
in Haines Twp. in Marion Co, built a house, and moved across the county line
into Marion Co. where he lived the remaining years of his life.  The remains
of this house were supposedly still standing until a few years prior to 1992.<BR>
