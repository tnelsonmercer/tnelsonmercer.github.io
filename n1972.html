The following was taken from "John Skelton of George" at the South Bend Public
Lib.
<BR>
It is a biography of William Skelton, submitted by Geroge Byers of South Bend.
<BR>

<BR>
William Skelton took land on Johns Creek, a north tributary of Enoree River,
Union
<BR>
District, SC, in 1770, selling it on 10 Oct, 1788.  William and wife Sarah
took land in
<BR>
Pendleton (now Anderson) Co, SC, on 13 July 1789, and deeded it away in 1791.
<BR>
He was two younger brothers, Thomas and Robert. Thomas was still in Union Co.
<BR>
in the 1790 census, but Robert had already moved to Pendleton Co.
<BR>

<BR>
William and family, with probable exception of the eldest son Jacob, who
followed
<BR>
later, moved from Pendleton (now Anderson) Co, SC, across the Savannah River,
<BR>
to Elbert Co, GA, and took land there on Cedar Creek in 1792, from John
Scales.
<BR>
In about 1803, the Skelton/Scales familes, much intermarried, began migration
<BR>
from Elbert Co, GA, and Pendleton Co, SC, to Warren Co, KY. It seems probable
<BR>
that John Skelton, son of William, led the way, as he was the first to pay
taxes
<BR>
in Warren Co, KY.  In late 1807, the Skelton/Scales group moved from Warren
Co,
<BR>
KY, into then Knox (now Gibson) Co, Indiana Territory. There William's sons
Jacob,
<BR>
James, and Robert, after participation in the battle of Tippecanoe, remained
until
<BR>
death.  Son Ralph migrated to Washington Co, Arkansas. Zachariah, with William
<BR>
Scales and Mary, moved on in 1815 into what is now Warrick Co, Zachariah near
<BR>
Polk Path (southese of present Selvin) and William Scales at Scalesville,
between
<BR>
present Lynnville and Selvin.
<BR>

<BR>
In the 1820 Census, first to be taken in Indiana, Zachariah has in his
household a
<BR>
male a generation older than he. Since his wife's father Thomas had died in
<BR>
Elbert Co, GA, in 1799, and since William Skelton is known to have paid taxes
<BR>
in Warren Co, KY, as "Senior" in 1806, it is believed that this male member of
<BR>
Zachariah's household was his father William Skelton. No such person appeared
<BR>
in Zachariah's household in the 1830 census, although Zachariah still lived at
the
<BR>
same location until 1837.
