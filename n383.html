!Private War of 1812; 7 children; in Capt. Thomas Ravenscraft's Company, Ky
<BR>
Militia, Discharged 8 Nov 1813; A VIEW OF HOME PLACE INDIANA,  by Jack and
<BR>
Janet Edwards, 1992, Library # 977.256: page 24; Soon after 1832 Isaac Sahrpe
<BR>
and others settled near the McShane farm and these neighbors banded togeather
<BR>
and organized a school which was conducted in a log cabin on Sharpe's land
<BR>
opposite the present site of Pleasant Grove Church.  In the Isaac Sharpe
<BR>
settlement the first regular church services were held in the log house
<BR>
mentioned above which had been erected for school purposes.   These services
<BR>
were conducted under Methodist auspices, preliminary services having been
<BR>
heldin the homes of Dennis Power and Samuel Seely as well as Isaac Sharpe's.
<BR>
The cabin built on Shahrpe's land was known as "Sharp's meetin house" and was
<BR>
used until 1854 or 1855. (page 45)  The cemetery at Pleasant Grove is
mentioned
<BR>
in several books as beginning in 1838.  I believe the Sharps ( Isaac and
Nancy)
<BR>
gave the land for the church and the cemetery in 1837.  We believe the only
<BR>
veteran buried at Pleasant Grove is Isaac Sharp and he served in the war of
<BR>
1812.  At this point we think Isaac Sharp needs more credit and recognition
for
<BR>
the positive effect he had on the area.  With the donation of land, the
<BR>
furnishing of a log cabin, the organization of a school, and the use of the
<BR>
cabin as a " Meeting House" (the first church) , he established the heart of
<BR>
the community known as Pleasant Grove.  This then became the center of the
Home
<BR>
Place Area.  Let us not forget those who are lesser known like Isaac Sharp,
who
<BR>
helped form our community at the most basic level.<BR>
