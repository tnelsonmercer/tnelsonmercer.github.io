Simpson enlisted for three years as a private in Company C, 58th
<BR>
Regiment in the Civil War. At that time he was 5' 7.5" tall, light
<BR>
complexioned with gray eyes and he listed his occupation as a
<BR>
carpenter.
<BR>

<BR>
During the Battle of Murfreesboro, or Battle of Stoneriver in Tennessee,
<BR>
on the 31st day of December 1862, he was wounded by a fragment of a
<BR>
shell on the left hand and three weeks later the army surgeon amputated
<BR>
a portio of his arm just above the wrist. He was honorably discharged
<BR>
because of this disability on April 18, 1863, and returned to Owensville,
<BR>
Indiana.
<BR>

<BR>
We worked at making hand-made furniture for some time in Fort Branch,
<BR>
Indiana, but in May of 1898, he applied for a pension.<BR>
