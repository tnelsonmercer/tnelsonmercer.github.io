From research of Maxine E. Wormer, March 22, 1992 (Copy at Princeton Library):
<BR>

<BR>
John & Jane KELL arrived in the colony of South Carolina in the first half of
1772, with
<BR>
his brothers and sisters: James Kell, Mathew Kell, Jannet Jell, Mary Kell, and
Henry
<BR>
Kell, and Archibald Kell.  They must have departed from County Antrim,
Ireland,
<BR>
(thought to have lived in the Ballymens-Ballymoney area) in late 1771. It it
said that
<BR>
they were in the group of covenanters who followed Rev. William Martin, the
first
<BR>
covenanter minister in upper South Carolina.
<BR>

<BR>
Six of them (all but Archibald) petitioned for land on 20 July, 1772 under the
<BR>
headright system.  John petitioned for 350 acres of land which would
<BR>
indicate he had a wife and four children. Since we know know he only
<BR>
had two children at the time, he may have had two younger brothers
<BR>
or sisters in his care.
<BR>

<BR>
Royal Land Grants and Plat, Vol. 35 p 339, granting, "Three hundred fifty
acres on
<BR>
the waters of Rocky Creek in Craven County (Camden), S.C., bounded on the two
<BR>
lines with land surveyed for James Bigham, and on our lines said to be John
Wier's
<BR>
and on the other three lines with vacant lands."Apparently the original hand
drawn
<BR>
plat was lost because the S.C Archives did nto have it on record. However, a
new
<BR>
plat must have been drawn at the time the sons, Thomas and John, sold the
property
<BR>
in 1821-22.
<BR>

<BR>
Paul's Graveyard is located on the right side of the road from Richburg
<BR>
to Rossville in Chester Co, SC.
<BR>

<BR>
John Kell's gravestone reads:
<BR>
In Memory of Mr. John KELL
<BR>
Who Departed this life
<BR>
November 2nd A.D 1819
<BR>
Aged 83 Years
<BR>
In the year 1772 he Emigrated From Ireland, s'tained a share in the troubles
<BR>
of the Revolutionary War. As a profesur of religion he attached himself to the
<BR>
Reformed Presb' Church. He maintained his standing with furmness &
<BR>
manifested an integrity & zeal worthy of his profession. Faith made him look
<BR>
with triumph on the Tomb.<BR>
