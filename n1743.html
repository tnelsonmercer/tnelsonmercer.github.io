From "The Anderson Family of the Irish Settlement," by George R. Wilson:
<BR>
It is claimed that both Willim and his father, Gilbert, served in the American
<BR>
Revolutionary War. After William and Jane married, they lived near the
<BR>
junction of the Alleghany and Monogahela Rivers, then moved to
<BR>
Mercer Co, KY, where several of their children were born. During the
<BR>
War of 1812, William moved his family to Ireland, Dubois Co, IN,
<BR>
reaching their destination on May 7, 1815. His sons William, Jr, and
<BR>
Andrew, had come to Dubois Co. in the fall of 1814 and built a log
<BR>
cabin.  William, Sr, purchased 160 acres in Dubois Co, IN, with son
<BR>
Thomas, on 6 Nov. 1815. Here began the "Irish Settlement."
<BR>

<BR>
1820 Census of Bainbridge Twp, Dubois Co, IN: William Anderson, Sr, head of
<BR>
family consisting of two men age 16-26; one man age 26-45; one man over 45;
<BR>
two girls age 10-16; one woman age 16-26; and one woman over 45.  His son
<BR>
Thomas Anderson is listed as a separate family; a man age 26-45 and a woman
<BR>
age 16-26.
<BR>

<BR>
1830 Census of Bainbridge Twp, Dubois Co, IN: William Anderson, Sr, head of
<BR>
family of one man age 60-70; one woman age 20-30, and one woman age 60-70.
<BR>

<BR>
William Anderson, Sr, did not appear to apply for pension or for bounty land
from
<BR>
his service in the American Revolution. The name William Anderson does not
<BR>
appear on the Indiana list showing those drawing a pension in pursuance of the
<BR>
Act of Mar 18, 1818.
<BR>

<BR>
William and father Gilbert were recruited in August, 1781, into Capt. Robert
Miller's
<BR>
Fourth Company, Sixth Battallion, of Col. James Taylor's Regiment, from their
<BR>
home in Coleraine Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
<BR>

<BR>
William, Sr, spent his last days from December 1835, until his death, April
22, 1836,
<BR>
at the home of his son John Anderson.<BR>
