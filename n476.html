!The Riddell, Riddle, Ruddle Trail Vol V, No 2-3  Apr 1985-June 1986 made note
<BR>
that all children of this marriage, their first mate's names and their mother
<BR>
were cited in a suit Hawkins vs Byrd--O>S> 267; N>S> 94--Bill, 1813 (in
Records
<BR>
of Augusta Co, VA ,II, p 202); and it was stated that they all were living in
<BR>
Virginia at that date, 1813.  The suit was over land in Shenandoah Co.  Smutz,
<BR>
p 5, gave the marriage dates but did not indicate the place of marriage; nor
<BR>
where the license was issued.  The compiler found the licenses cited above in
<BR>
SHENDANDOAH CO, VA MARRIAGES, 1772-1850.  The others were not recorded there.
<BR>
They probably lived on Smith Creek, in Dunmore (now Shenandoah) Co, Va, and
<BR>
probably all the listed children were born there and many of them continued to
<BR>
live in that area.<BR>
