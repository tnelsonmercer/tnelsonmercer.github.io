Early in the twenties Andrew McGregor(y) moved to the neighborhood of what is
<BR>
now Somerville, IN. The next year the 2 oldest boys, George and John, put in
<BR>
all their time hunting. That winter they sold enough venison hams to come to
<BR>
$75 at $0.25 a pair. They entered 40 acres of land and had enough left to
<BR>
purchase supplies. The next year George, the oldest son, killed deer, caught
<BR>
coons, and paid for 80 acres of land, for which he was nicknamed "George,
<BR>
the Deer Killer." The father of these boys was from Ireland, coming to this
<BR>
country after he was 60 years old. (?) The old gentleman could never become
<BR>
used to the many strange things he found on every hand...(Incident of
<BR>
Andrew trying to retrieve a hornets nest in a tree that he mistook for a jug
<BR>
and was stung and fell out of the tree.)
